    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Warning: This section contains spoilers!</p>
    <p>In 2016 I began using online dating websites as platforms to interview men about their ideas about sexual consent. I specifically targeted people who made problematic statements about consent in their profiles such as: “sometimes a no is really just a yes in disguise.” Several Midgray projects were created using the data and interviews collected. </p>
    <p>What struck me about the conversations I had with men on these websites was that most of the people I interviewed absolutely did not think of themselves as having the propensity to commit sexual assault in spite of the problematic nature of the statements made in their profiles. People were so invested in the idea of themselves as a “good guy” who could never rape that they rarely took the time to examine the harm their words, beliefs, and behaviors could potentially cause.</p>
    <p>My take away from these interviews was that in order to curb the prevalence of sexual assault education in empathy and emotional intelligence is vital. I believe in the power of stories and games to facilitate empathetic teachable moments and so for this project, I set out to create a work of young adult interactive fiction that would highlight how even a likable character who the reader controls could easily make choices that could lead to harm if too many assumptions were made in the pursuit of the fulfillment of a personal narrative.</p>
    <p>In the story the reader navigates the archetypical college hookup scene. I chose this setting because, during the course of my research, something repeated across multiple sources was that young people face enormous pressure by the media, their peers, and collegiate institutions to have “the college experience”. For many students, this pressure commonly leads to the belief that whatever amount of sex they are having is never enough. They are lagging on the sexual playing field and that they need to catch up. This is driving them toward risky behaviors that increase their likelihood to both commit assault or be assaulted. This pressure in conjunction with low literacy in regards to sexual health, consent, and pornography has created a public health crisis on college campuses— a burden which is commonly carried by female students in their first 6 months of their college careers.</p>
    <p>Research by authors Peggy Orenstein (Girls and Sex and Boys and Sex) and Jennifer S. Hrisch and Shaus Khan (Sexual Citizens) were vital in informing the narrative direction of the story. It was clear to me from the interviews they performed with teens and young adults that it was essential to address issues of gender and power. I was particularly interested in exploring the different ways power can be experienced and wielded— a person might assume a great deal of power in one sexual encounter, but be made to feel powerless in another. This expression of power can conform to traditional gender norms, but not exclusively.</p>
